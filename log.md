# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 18th, 2018 (Setting up environment for todo app)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to successfully configure my environment to get to the point where I can push and view changes in code. I'm using xCode's iOS Simulator with the expo app. Yarn is packaging my Javascript and pushing to this app. 

**Thoughts:** I really need to get used to using a Mac again. Coding in windows for 3 years and not having used MacOS since my junior year has really taken a toll. I also need to pay attention to the files I'm editting and where they are located. I spent way too long trying to figure out why my code changes weren't being pushed to expo... Turns out I was editting the file that was automatically in my iCloud drive, and not the one that I was telling yarn to package. All in all I'm pretty excited to continue this work. I spent way more than an hour on today's work, but I really wanted to push past the initial setup to get things rolling.
