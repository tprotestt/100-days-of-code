# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 18th, 2018 (Setting up environment for todo app)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to successfully configure my environment to get to the point where I can push and view changes in code. I'm using xCode's iOS Simulator with the expo app. Yarn is packaging my Javascript and pushing to this app. 

**Thoughts:** I really need to get used to using a Mac again. Coding in windows for 3 years and not having used MacOS since my junior year has really taken a toll. I also need to pay attention to the files I'm editting and where they are located. I spent way too long trying to figure out why my code changes weren't being pushed to expo... Turns out I was editting the file that was automatically in my iCloud drive, and not the one that I was telling yarn to package. All in all I'm pretty excited to continue this work. I spent way more than an hour on today's work, but I really wanted to push past the initial setup to get things rolling.

### Day 1: March 19th, 2018 (Getting aquainted with ReactJS)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I followed along with the example getting myself aquainted with JS. For some reason I have a fatal bug so I can't view the app, just the error. I also need to figure out how to make the add button appear "pressable" 

**Thoughts:** I feel pretty overwhelmed with how much JS I don't understand. There's so much syntax I don't understand. Not sure whether to pause and do some research on JS before I continue, or just to keep chugging along hoping I'll grasp it along the way.

### Day 2: March 20th, 2018 (Troubleshooting)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to troubleshoot through my issue from yesterday as well as power through a couple more issues I ran into today. Most were spelling/settings in my config file. I am running into an issue with my todo's being added to ElasticSearch, but I think I might be onto something there.  

**Thoughts:** A few wins today! I'm getting quicker at determining causes of bugs and becoming further acquainted with react.js. Feeling good!

### Day 3: March 21th, 2018 (More Troubleshooting)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today's progress is similar to yesterday's. I was able to troubleshoot another bug today but was immediately stopped on the next one that presented itself. Todos are now pushing to ElasticSearch but the todos are not displaying on the front end.   

**Thoughts:** A little frustrated. Getting a little impatient. Spent over an hour plugging away. Will come back tomorrow with some positivity.

### Day 4: March 22th, 2018 (More Troubleshooting, No Progress)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't make any progress today. Went over all of my code to make sure there weren't any typos. Trying to keep in mind that with only coding an hour a day, while I've been working on the same problem during the span of 2 days, I have only been stuck for 1.5 hours. I've had worse.

### Day 5: March 23th, 2018 (Finished...)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the todo app. Played around with styles and started researching other elements to add to it to spice it up a little bit. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling rather underwhelmed. Will be continuing research over the next few days and see if I can spice this app up a little bit.

**Today's Progress**: Working through freecodecamp's little program. Need to re-educate myself in css and practice my javascript a little before I continue into some coding challenges. 

**Thoughts:** Excited!

### Day 8: March 26th, 2018 (Understanding React.js)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Researched ins and outs of react.js 

**Thoughts:** One of those days that I didn't get to sit down until I started coding. By this time, I had zero motivation to actually code, but I sat through some tutorials anyways. NEED MORE HOURS IN THE DAY.

### Day 9: March 27th, 2018 (Rounding out research with React.js)

### Day 13: March 31st, 2018 (Bootstrap 4 /Jquery sliders.)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Got my environment set up with all of the appropriate scripts to get this image slider started.   

**Thoughts:** Taking time to read everything I can (within reason) that I'm putting into my environment, so things like getting started are taking longer than I'd expected. Hoping to have something to show for all the time soon.



### Day 14: April 1st, 2018 (Styling on Slides!)
#####

### Day 16: April 3rd, 2018 (another slider...)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Followed another slider tutorial and still don't have a working mock up.   

**Thoughts:** Honestly kinda over logging this.  

### Day 17: April 4th, 2018 (another slider...)
#####

### Day 20: April 7th, 2018 (Bootstrap from the top!)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started a bootstrap coding challenge

**Thoughts:** Need to remind myself to stop trying to jump straight in and start from the ground up. The last 3 years of my job was trial by fire coding wise, so it's time to break the habit and form new and more productive ones.   

### Day 21: April 8th, 2018 (more bootstrap practice)
